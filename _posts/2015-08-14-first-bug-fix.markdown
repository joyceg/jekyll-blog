Today seems to  be a better day for me after a very long time.Yea,my first bug fix was reviewed and tested by the Drupal community.This was something I was dreaming of since a very long time.Many of my friends used to ask "what where you doing all these months?" and I used to be completely dumbstuck.I tried on many organisations and finally [Drupal ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal)seems to be the one which got clicked.Moreover.I think this might be something I can remember of for the month of August 2015.

I started my open source interaction with [WikiMedia community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation).I cloned their git repo and started surfing for various bugs.I found some,but most of them were out of my reach(I felt it like a himalayan task to work with).I spent really a very long time time.I learnt a lot new things.I  learnt about phabricator,where we can find bugs reported in wikimedia and the review process in WIkimedia-[Gerrit](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/).I interacted with some of the developers there.

On the mean while,I worked with a firefox App-[Quiz-Mania](https://github.com/joyceg/Quiz-Mania).It got launched in the [firefox marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/quiz-mania-1/) too.So,that was the first phase.

Then,I decided to improve my php skills by getting involved with  web development.I made php forms and that helped me a lot.

At the meanwhile I also came across [KDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE) and [FEDORA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)).But,I wasn't much impressed of.I surfed many organisations and finally landed up at Drupal.It is based on content management systems(CMS).I got a Drupal account and started communicating with developers in #Drupal IRC chats.I got many helpful developers and started following their instructions.I cloned  their git repo and started working on a minor [issue](https://www.drupal.org/node/2538158).I worked on the issue and I was able to send two patches for two different versions of Drupal(7 and 8) for the same issue.It got reviewed and tested by the Drupal community within a few days.

Yes,really a energy boosting moment.I am now encouraged to do more and more open source contributions .I hope I can contribute even more in the  coming days. :)
