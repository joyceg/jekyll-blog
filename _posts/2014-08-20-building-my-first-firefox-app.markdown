When I learn new programming languages,I always used to wonder what is the real use of these coding(because I couldn't actually make any useful project /Application using it). I got into its significance only when Vipin sir  and Tony  Thomas of [FOSS](http://foss.amrita.ac.in/site/)    club took me to the basics of app development. I feel really interested in the app development and I'm looking for good ideas to build a useful app for the Firefox OS.I have practised some basic codings of(html,css and Javascript) from [codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/learn).It will be helpful for me in building my app.Anyway,my present aim is to get a good topic(idea) for my App.
